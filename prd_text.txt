1. Project Title
   Product Requirements Document: Basic Todo Application

2. Overview
   Description: This document outlines the requirements for a basic, web-based Todo application. The application will provide users with the ability to create, view, update, and delete tasks. The end goal is a functional, single-user task management tool with a clean user interface and a robust backend, built on modern, widely-adopted technologies. The project will serve as a foundational product that can be enhanced with more advanced features in the future.

   Technology Stack:
   - Frontend:
     - Framework: React (with Next.js). Next.js is a popular React framework that enables features like server-side rendering and static site generation, which can improve performance and SEO.
     - State Management: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for basic state management. For more complex state, Zustand is recommended for its simplicity and performance.
     - UI Component Library: A component library like Shadcn/UI or Material-UI to ensure a consistent and accessible design system.
     - Styling: Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach that allows for rapid and custom styling.

   - Backend:
     - Runtime Environment: Node.js.
     - Framework: Express.js. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
     - API Architecture: RESTful API. This will ensure a stateless, loosely coupled interface between the client and server.

   - Database:
     - Database System: MongoDB. As a NoSQL database, MongoDB provides flexibility for evolving data models. Alternatively, for simplicity in early stages, SQLite can be used.

3. Goals and Objectives
   - UX Goals:
     - The user interface should be intuitive, clean, and user-friendly, requiring minimal learning curve.
     - The application must be fast and responsive, allowing users to add and manage tasks without delay.
     - Implement a mobile-first responsive design to ensure optimal viewing and interaction across various devices and screen sizes.

   - Performance Goals:
     - API response times for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations should be under 200ms.
     - The frontend application should achieve a high-performance score on web vitals metrics.

   - Scalability Goals:
     - The architecture should be modular to allow for future enhancements without major refactoring.
     - The backend should be designed to handle a growing number of users and tasks efficiently.

   - Maintainability Goals:
     - The codebase should be well-structured and documented, following best practices for clean architecture.
     - Separation of concerns between the frontend and backend should be strictly maintained.

4. Key Features and Functional Requirements (Backend)
   - User Task Management (CRUD Operations):
     - Create a New Task:
       - What it does: Allows a user to add a new task to their list.
       - How it works: The backend will expose a POST endpoint (e.g., `/api/todos`). The request body will contain the task details, which will then be saved to the database.
       - Recommended data model: A JSON object representing a task with fields such as `id` (unique identifier), `title` (string), `completed` (boolean), and `createdAt` (timestamp).

     - Read All Tasks:
       - What it does: Retrieves all existing tasks for the user.
       - How it works: A GET endpoint (e.g., `/api/todos`) will fetch all task documents from the database and return them as a JSON array.

     - Update a Task:
       - What it does: Allows a user to modify an existing task (e.g., mark as complete, edit the title).
       - How it works: A PUT or PATCH endpoint (e.g., `/api/todos/:id`) will be used to update a specific task identified by its ID. The request body will contain the fields to be updated.

     - Delete a Task:
       - What it does: Permanently removes a task from the user's list.
       - How it works: A DELETE endpoint (e.g., `/api/todos/:id`) will remove the task document corresponding to the provided ID from the database.

5. Application Structure (Frontend)
   - Major Pages and Purpose:
     - Main Todo Page: A single-page interface where users can view, add, and manage their tasks. The layout will be simple to maintain focus on task management.

   - Important UI Components:
     - Header: Displays the application title.
     - TodoForm: An input field and a button for adding new tasks.
     - TodoList: A container that lists all the todo items. It will handle filtering logic to show all, active, or completed tasks.
     - TodoItem: An individual task component that displays the task title, a checkbox to mark it as complete, and a button to delete it.
     - Footer: Contains options for filtering tasks and a "clear completed" button.

   - Recommended Design Framework or Library:
     - Material-UI or a similar component library will be used to ensure a consistent and professional look and feel, providing pre-built components like buttons, input fields, and icons.

   - Responsive Design Principles:
     - The application will adopt a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the layout and components are optimized for small screens before scaling up for tablets and desktops.

6. Data Flow (Backend + Frontend Integration)
   - How data flows through the system:
     - The frontend application will communicate with the backend via RESTful API calls over HTTP.
     - User interactions in the UI (e.g., adding a task) will trigger API requests to the backend. The backend will process the request, interact with the database, and send back a response.

   - APIs used for communication:
     - `GET /api/todos`: Fetches all tasks.
     - `POST /api/todos`: Creates a new task.
     - `PUT /api/todos/:id`: Updates an existing task.
     - `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: Deletes a task.

   - Example Workflows:
     - Adding a Task: The user types a task into the `TodoForm` and clicks "Add". An `onSubmit` event handler triggers a `POST` request to `/api/todos`. Upon a successful response, the frontend state is updated to include the new task, re-rendering the `TodoList`.
     - Marking a Task as Complete: The user clicks the checkbox on a `TodoItem`. An `onChange` event handler triggers a `PUT` request to `/api/todos/:id` with `{ "completed": true }`. The backend updates the task in the database, and the frontend updates the UI to reflect the change.

   - State Management Approach:
     - The primary state of the todo list will be managed within the main application component using the `useState` hook. Asynchronous operations like data fetching will be handled using the `useEffect` hook. For fetching and caching server state, React Query is a highly recommended library.

7. Testing and Performance Considerations
   - Unit and Integration Testing:
     - Unit tests will be written for individual components and backend services using frameworks like Jest.
     - Integration tests will verify the interaction between different parts of the application, such as the frontend components and the API.

   - End-to-End (E2E) and Security Testing:
     - E2E tests will be implemented using tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate user workflows from the browser.
     - Basic security testing will be performed to identify vulnerabilities such as injection risks from unfiltered inputs.

   - Tools/Frameworks Recommended Online:
     - Frontend Testing: Jest with React Testing Library for component testing.
     - Backend Testing: Jest or Mocha for unit and integration tests.
     - E2E Testing: Playwright or Cypress for automated browser testing.

8. Future Enhancements
   - Collaboration and Task Sharing: Allow users to share task lists and assign responsibilities to others.
   - Due Dates and Reminders: Add the ability to set due dates for tasks and receive notifications.
   - Calendar Integration: Integrate with calendar services to visualize tasks and deadlines.
   - AI-Powered Features: Introduce AI to help users prioritize tasks or suggest actionable steps.
   - Voice Input: Allow users to add tasks using voice commands for quick capture.
   - User Authentication: Implement user accounts to allow individuals to save and access their lists from multiple devices.
