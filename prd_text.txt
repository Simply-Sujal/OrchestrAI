1. Project Title
   Product Requirements Document: Basic Todo List Application

2. Overview
   Description: This document outlines the product requirements for a basic yet robust Todo List application. The application will allow users to manage their tasks efficiently through a clean and intuitive user interface. The end goal is to provide a reliable and performant task management tool that serves as a foundational product, which can be enhanced with more advanced features in the future.

   Technology Stack:
   - Frontend: React.js
   - Backend: Node.js with Express.js
   - Database: MongoDB
   - Frameworks/Libraries:
     - Frontend UI: Ant Design
     - State Management: React Context API or Zustand for simplicity and scalability.
   - APIs: RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend.

3. Goals and Objectives
   - UX Goals:
     - To provide a simple, intuitive, and user-friendly interface for managing tasks.
     - Ensure the application is responsive and accessible across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
   - Performance Goals:
     - Achieve fast load times and a responsive user experience.
     - Optimize frontend and backend performance to handle a reasonable number of concurrent users and tasks without degradation.
   - Scalability Goals:
     - The architecture should be modular to allow for future enhancements and the addition of new features with minimal friction.
     - The database schema should be designed to scale efficiently as the number of users and tasks grows.
   - Maintainability Goals:
     - Adhere to clean architecture principles to ensure the codebase is easy to understand, modify, and maintain.
     - Implement a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure code quality and stability.

4. Key Features and Functional Requirements (Backend)
   - User Authentication:
     - What it does: Allows users to register and log in to the application securely.
     - How it works: Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. Upon successful login, a token is generated and sent to the client, which must be included in the headers of subsequent requests to protected endpoints.
     - Recommended data models or APIs:
       - `User` model: `userId`, `username`, `email`, `passwordHash`.
       - API endpoints: `POST /api/users/register`, `POST /api/users/login`.

   - Task Management (CRUD Operations):
     - What it does: Enables users to create, read, update, and delete their tasks.
     - How it works:
       - Create: A user can add a new task with a title and an optional description.
       - Read: A user can view a list of all their tasks.
       - Update: A user can edit the title, description, and completion status of a task.
       - Delete: A user can remove a task from their list.
     - Recommended data models or APIs:
       - `Task` model: `taskId`, `userId` (foreign key), `title`, `description`, `isCompleted`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
       - API endpoints:
         - `POST /api/tasks` (Create a new task)
         - `GET /api/tasks` (Get all tasks for the logged-in user)
         - `GET /api/tasks/:taskId` (Get a single task)
         - `PUT /api/tasks/:taskId` (Update a task)
         - `DELETE /api/tasks/:taskId` (Delete a task)

5. Application Structure (Frontend)
   - Major Pages and Purpose:
     - Login/Register Page: A simple form for user authentication.
     - Todo List Page: The main page where users can view, add, and manage their tasks.
   - Important UI Components:
     - `TaskList`: A component to display the list of todo items.
     - `TaskItem`: A component representing a single todo item with options to edit, delete, and mark as complete.
     - `AddTaskForm`: A form component for adding new tasks.
     - `Header`: A component for the application header, which may include the app title and a logout button.
   - Recommended Design Framework or Library: Ant Design for a professional look and feel with a rich set of pre-built components.
   - Responsive Design Principles: Employ a mobile-first approach, ensuring the layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes using CSS media queries or a grid system provided by the UI framework.

6. Data Flow (Backend + Frontend Integration)
   - How data flows through the system: The frontend application communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls. User actions in the UI trigger API requests to the backend, which then interacts with the database to perform the requested operations. The backend responds with data (e.g., a list of tasks) or a status confirmation, which the frontend then uses to update the UI.
   - APIs used for communication: HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the REST API endpoints defined in the backend functional requirements.
   - Example Workflows:
     - Adding a Task:
       1. The user types a new task into the `AddTaskForm` and clicks "Add".
       2. The frontend sends a `POST` request to `/api/tasks` with the task details in the request body.
       3. The backend validates the data, creates a new task in the database associated with the logged-in user, and returns the newly created task object.
       4. The frontend updates its state with the new task, causing the UI to re-render and display the new task in the `TaskList`.
   - State Management Approach: Utilize React's `useState` and `useContext` hooks for managing local and global state respectively. This approach is lightweight and sufficient for a basic todo list application. For applications that might grow in complexity, Zustand is a popular and simple alternative.

7. Testing and Performance Considerations
   - Unit and Integration Testing:
     - Backend: Use frameworks like Jest or Mocha to write unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for API endpoints.
     - Frontend: Use React Testing Library to write tests that simulate user interactions with the components.
   - Load Testing: Use tools like Apache JMeter or k6 to simulate multiple users accessing the application to identify performance bottlenecks.
   - Security:
     - Implement password hashing for user credentials.
     - Ensure that users can only access and modify their own tasks.
     - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
   - Responsiveness: Regularly test the application on different devices and browsers to ensure a consistent and optimal user experience.

8. Future Enhancements
   - Task Prioritization: Allow users to set priority levels for their tasks (e.g., low, medium, high).
   - Due Dates and Reminders: Add the ability to set due dates for tasks and receive notifications.
   - Task Filtering and Sorting: Allow users to filter tasks by their completion status and sort them by creation date or priority.
   - Subtasks: Enable users to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks.
   - Collaboration and Sharing: Allow users to share their todo lists with others and collaborate on tasks.
   - AI-Powered Features: Integrate AI to help users prioritize tasks or suggest task breakdowns.

9. Conclusion
   This Product Requirements Document provides a comprehensive and structured foundation for the development of a basic Todo List application. By adhering to the outlined requirements, technology stack, and best practices gathered from current online resources, the development team can build a high-quality, scalable, and maintainable product that meets the core needs of users seeking a simple and effective task management solution.
