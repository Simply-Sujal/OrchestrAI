1. Project Title
   Product Requirements Document: Basic To-Do List Application

2. Overview
   Description: This document outlines the product requirements for a basic To-Do List web application. The application will allow users to create, manage, and track their tasks through a clean and intuitive user interface. The end goal is to provide a reliable and straightforward task management tool that serves as a foundational product, built upon modern and scalable technologies.

   Technology Stack:
   - Frontend: React.js. React is recommended for its component-based architecture and efficiency in building dynamic user interfaces.
   - Backend: Node.js with Express.js. This combination is lightweight, fast, and capable of handling asynchronous operations, making it ideal for a RESTful API.
   - Database: MongoDB. As a NoSQL database, MongoDB offers flexibility with its document-based data model, which is well-suited for the simple structure of to-do list items.
   - Frameworks/APIs: RESTful API for client-server communication.

3. Goals and Objectives
   - UX Goals:
     - To provide a clean, uncluttered, and intuitive user interface that allows for easy task management.
     - Ensure the application is responsive and provides a seamless experience across various devices.
     - Interactions should be simple, with clear visual feedback for actions like adding, completing, or deleting a task.

   - Performance Goals:
     - Achieve fast load times and a responsive UI by leveraging a virtual DOM (React).
     - Ensure backend API responses are delivered quickly, with efficient database queries.

   - Scalability Goals:
     - The architecture should be modular to allow for future feature enhancements with minimal friction.
     - The backend should be stateless to allow for horizontal scaling if user load increases.

   - Maintainability Goals:
     - Adhere to a component-based architecture on the frontend for reusable and isolated components.
     - Maintain a clean and well-documented codebase with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend.

4. Key Features and Functional Requirements (Backend)
   - Task Creation:
     - What it does: Allows a user to add a new task to their to-do list.
     - How it works: The backend will expose a POST endpoint (e.g., `/api/tasks`) that accepts a JSON object containing the task details. The server will validate the input, create a new task document, and save it to the database.
     - Recommended data model: A MongoDB collection for tasks with fields such as `taskName` (String), `isCompleted` (Boolean), and `createdAt` (Date).

   - View All Tasks:
     - What it does: Retrieves and displays all existing tasks for a user.
     - How it works: A GET endpoint (e.g., `/api/tasks`) will query the database for all task documents and return them as a JSON array.
     - Recommended data models or APIs: The API will return an array of task objects.

   - Update Task Status:
     - What it does: Allows a user to mark a task as complete or incomplete.
     - How it works: A PUT or PATCH endpoint (e.g., `/api/tasks/:id`) will be used to update the `isCompleted` status of a specific task identified by its ID. The server will find the task by its unique ID and update the boolean field.
     - Recommended data models or APIs: The API will accept the task ID as a URL parameter and the updated status in the request body.

   - Delete Task:
     - What it does: Permanently removes a task from the list.
     - How it works: A DELETE endpoint (e.g., `/api/tasks/:id`) will take a task ID as a parameter, find the corresponding document in the database, and remove it.
     - Recommended data models or APIs: The API will use the task ID from the URL to identify and delete the correct task.

5. Application Structure (Frontend)
   - Major Pages and Purpose:
     - Main View: A single-page interface that displays the entire to-do list. This view will contain all the core components for interacting with the tasks.

   - Important UI Components:
     - `TaskInputForm`: A form component with a text input field and a submit button to add new tasks.
     - `TaskList`: A component that renders the list of all tasks. It will map over the array of tasks and display each one.
     - `TaskItem`: A component representing a single task. It will include the task description, a checkbox to mark it as complete, and a delete button.

   - Recommended Design Framework or Library:
     - Material-UI or Tailwind CSS. These are popular choices for styling React applications, offering pre-built components and utility classes to speed up development and ensure a clean design.

   - Responsive Design Principles:
     - The application layout should adapt to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops. This can be achieved using a flexible grid system or media queries to ensure usability on all devices.

6. Data Flow (Backend + Frontend Integration)
   - How data flows through the system: The frontend application will communicate with the backend via asynchronous HTTP requests (API calls) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
   - APIs used for communication: A RESTful API will be used with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE) to manage task data. JSON will be the standard format for data transfer.
   - Example Workflows:
     - Adding a Task:
       1. The user types a task into the `TaskInputForm` and clicks "Add".
       2. The frontend sends a POST request to `/api/tasks` with the task description.
       3. The backend saves the new task to the MongoDB database.
       4. The frontend then fetches the updated list of tasks to re-render the `TaskList` component.
   - State Management Approach:
     - For a basic to-do list application, React's built-in `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are sufficient for managing the application's state, such as the list of tasks. For more complex applications, a state management library like Redux or Zustand could be considered.

7. Testing and Performance Considerations
   - Unit and Integration Testing:
     - Frontend: Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing individual components.
     - Backend: Use frameworks like Mocha or Jest to test API endpoints and business logic.
     - It is a best practice to start testing early in the development cycle to catch bugs sooner.

   - Load Testing, Security, Responsiveness:
     - Load Testing: Tools like JMeter or Postman can be used to simulate concurrent users and test the performance of the API under load.
     - Security: Basic security measures should be implemented, such as data validation on the server-side to prevent malicious input.
     - Responsiveness: Test the application across multiple browsers and devices to ensure cross-browser compatibility and a consistent user experience.

8. Future Enhancements
   - User Authentication: Implement user accounts to allow individuals to have their own private to-do lists.
   - Due Dates and Reminders: Add the ability to set due dates for tasks and receive notifications.
   - Task Prioritization: Allow users to set priority levels for tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
   - Multiple Lists: Enable users to create and manage multiple to-do lists for different projects or categories.
   - Subtasks: Allow users to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks.

9. Conclusion
